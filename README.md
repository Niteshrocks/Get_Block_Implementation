# Get_Block_Implementation
Command Line Linux Shell for simulation of allocating disk blocks function of Operating System


## Description :
- Language – C++
- Approach – Multithreading
- IDE – Visual Studio Code

## Commands :
- echo------Printing HashQueue, FreeList and ProcessList
- addblk----Adding block to the hashqueue
- getblk----Requesting for buffer block
- brelse----Releasing the allocated buffer block
- clear-----Clear the screen
- help------Open the help section

### echo :
It take only one parameter.
- hashqueue for printing HashQueue
- freelist for printing FreeList
- processlist for printing ProcessList

### addblk - ADD BLOCK :
It takes two parameters ( block number and status of the block )
- block number is any integer value
- status 1 - unlocked block / 3 - block marked as delayed write

### getblk - GET BLOCK :
It takes only one parameter
- block number is any integer value

### brelse - BLOCK RELEASE :
It takes only one parameter
- block number is any integer value

## Running the Program :
- Open terminal/Command promt and change directory to the folder of the
project ( BufferCache ).
- *Linux – Type<br>
make
- *Windows – Check out GnuWin's make, which provides a native port for
Windows (without requiring a full runtime environment like Cygwin).
- Type – make clean<br>
for removing compiled files of header files.
- run - ./bufferCache
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- This command invokes main.cpp file and create a shell of bufferCache.
- Add block using addblk command e.g addblk 25 1. where addblk is
command, 25 is block number and 1 is status ( unlocked ).
- After this command you can check by using - echo hashqueue and
echo freelist command that block is added to the both hashqueue and
freelist.
- Use getblk command for requesting a block. This create new thread
which runs independently in the background until block is allocated.
e.g getblk 48 . getblk is command and 48 is block number.
- run echo processlist command to check that process is added to the
processlist and it displays the process ID provided by the OS.
- If requested block is unlocked and present in freelist then it is allocated to
that process after that particular thread process terminates and removed
from the processlist.
- But if block is marked as delayed write, then a 20 seconds simulated
asynchronous write has been done and after that block is available to
allocate.
- use brelse command to release the particular block.
- use help command for further help.
